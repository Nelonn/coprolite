# Coprolite

### Minecraft ~~core~~ server launcher

It's a stripped down version of Fabric Loader.

## Features 
- Mixin [(Fabric Wiki)](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:mixin_registration) [(Mixin Wiki)](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/wiki)

## How to run with PaperMC

```shell
java -Xmx4G -Dcoprolite.jar=./paper-1.20.4-340.jar -jar coprolite-launcher-0.0.1.jar nogui
```

Additionally install [Coprolite Paper](https://github.com/Nelonn/coprolite-paper) into plugins directory

You can manually define plugins directory for coprolite using `-Dcoprolite.pluginsFolder=./coprolite_plugins`, by default it's `./plugins`

## Plugin structure

See [example plugin](https://github.com/Nelonn/coprolite-example-plugin)

  "id": "mod-id",
  "name": "Example Mod",
  "version": "${version}",
  "authors": [

  ],

  ]
}
```

## Project layout

- `coprolite-api` contains Сoprolite loader api
- `coprolite-loader` contains platform-independent implementation of Сoprolite loader _(if desired, it can be used at least as the client mod loader)_
- `coprolite-launcher` contains launcher for Сoprolite loader, usually for PaperMC and its forks
